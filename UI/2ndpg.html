        <p>Hello! I am an AI & ML student with a passion for exploring the fascinating world of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. My journey in this field began with a deep curiosity about how intelligent machines can be created to mimic human-like behavior and make informed decisions. Through my studies, I have gained a solid foundation in various AI and ML concepts, algorithms, and frameworks.
        As an AI & ML student, I have had the opportunity to work on diverse projects, ranging from image recognition and natural language processing to predictive analytics and recommendation systems. These experiences have not only honed my technical skills but also taught me the importance of data-driven decision-making and the ethical considerations surrounding AI development.
        I am particularly interested in exploring the intersection of AI and other domains such as healthcare, finance, and environmental sustainability. I believe that AI&ML have the potential to revolutionize these industries, making them more efficient, accessible, and sustainable.
